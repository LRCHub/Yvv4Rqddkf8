[00:22.03] You say those proverbs as if you had contrived them
[00:27.85] I know your arrogance but do not point it out
[00:33.35] And you've not changed a bit in three long decimal years
[00:39.09] I think your flaw isn't so much your fault as a charm
[01:05.59] 
[00:45.03] Maybe I will meet you one day
[00:50.43] Maybe Wednesday, maybe not (not)
[00:56.25] Still, I'm sure to meet you anyway
[01:01.61] Maybe Thursday, maybe not (not)
[01:17.11] 
[01:07.39] I want to be you
[01:09.38] Just like a leaf that has flown away
[01:14.03] With the wind and the rain
[01:17.73] This romance it's so mellow and so real just like a song
[01:22.73] That has died away
[01:25.62] With a flash in the night
[01:28.40] I would like to be composed of you
[01:45.40] 
[01:40.62] You tell your stories as if you had no respect for anyone
[01:47.73] I sing my songs as if I were a prostitute
[01:52.38] You take a snap at me, and stuff yourself on my welfare
[01:59.36] I feel like I am clinging to a cloud
[02:17.36] 
[02:03.82] Maybe I will kiss you slowly
[02:09.32] Maybe quickly, maybe not (not)
[02:15.09] Still, I'm sure to kiss you anyway
[02:20.49] Maybe sweetly, maybe not (not)
[02:35.49] 
[02:26.20] I want to be you
[02:28.43] It's hard to spend a lifetime for myself
[02:33.27] With the quakes and the storm
[02:36.36] This romance is an error and surreal
[02:39.80] It's clear that I love your insensitiveness
[02:44.33] Like the hills in the sky
[02:47.69] I would like to be merged into you
[03:04.69] 
[02:49.28] I want to be you
[02:51.16] Just like a leaf that has flown away
[02:55.64] With the wind and the rain
[02:58.83] This romance it's so mellow and so real
[03:02.45] Just like a song
[03:04.38] That has died away
[03:07.16] With the flash in the night
[03:10.29] I would like to composed of you
[03:25.79] 
[03:11.88] I want to be you
[03:13.54] It's hard to spend a lifetime for myself
[03:18.27] With the quakes and the storm
[03:21.31] This romance is an error and surreal
[03:24.87] It's clear that I love your insensitiveness
[03:29.78] Like the hills in the sky
[03:32.81] I would like to be merged into you
[03:49.81] 
[03:34.47] I want to be you
[03:36.40] Just like a leaf that has flown away
[03:41.06] With the wind and the rain
[03:44.35] This romance it's so mellow and so real
[03:47.55] Just like a song
[03:49.67] That has died away
[03:52.37] With the flash in the night
[03:55.35] I would like to be, would like to be
