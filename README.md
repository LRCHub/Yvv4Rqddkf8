# 東京事変 – 現実を嗤う

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
you say those proverbs
as if you had contrived them
i know your arrogance,
but do not point it out
and you've not changed a bit
in three long dismal years
i think your flaw isn't so much
your fault as a charm
maybe i will meet you one day,
maybe wednesday,
maybe not... not
still, i'm sure to meet you
anyway, maybe thursday,
maybe not... not
i want to be you
just like a leaf
that has flown away
with the wind and the rain
this“romance”is so mellow,
and“so real”
just like a song
that has died away
with a flash in the night
i would like to be
composed of you
you tell your stories as if
you had no respect for anyone
i sing my songs
as if i were a prostitute
you take a snap at me,
and stuff yourself on my welfare
i feel like i am clinging
to a cloud
maybe i will kiss you slowly,
maybe quickly, maybe not... not
still, i'm sure to kiss you
anyway, maybe sweetly,
maybe not... not
i want to be you
it's hard to spend a lifetime
for myself with the quakes
and the storm
this“romance”is an error,
and“surreal”
it's clear that i love
your insensitiveness
like the hills and the sky
i would like to be
merged into you
i want to be you
just like a leaf
that has flown away
with the wind and the rain
this“romance”is so mellow,
and“so real”
just like a song
that has died away
with a flash in the night
i would like to be
composed of you
i want to be you
it's hard to spend a lifetime
for myself with the quakes
and the storm
this“romance”is an error,
and“surreal”
it's clear that i love
your insensitiveness
like the hills and the sky
i would like to be
merged into you
i want to be you
just like a leaf
that has flown away
with the wind and the rain
this“romance”is so mellow,
and“so real”
just like a song
that has died away
with a flash in the night
i would like to be
i would like to be
