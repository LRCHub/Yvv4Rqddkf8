you say those proverbs as
if you had contrived them
i know your arrogance, but do not point it out
and you've not changed a bit in three
long dismal years
i think your flaw isn't so much
your fault as a charm
maybe i will meet you one day,
maybe wednesday, maybe not...
still, i'm sure to meet you anyway,
maybe thursday, maybe not...
i want to be you
just like a leaf that has flown away
with the wind and the rain
this“romance”is so mellow, and“so real”
just like a song that has died away
with a flash in the night
i would like to be composed of you
you tell your stories as if you had no respect
for anyone
i sing my songs as if i were a prostitute
you take a snap at me,
and stuff yourself on my welfare
i feel like i am clinging to a cloud
maybe i will kiss you slowly,
maybe quickly, maybe not...
still, i'm sure to kiss you anyway,
maybe sweetly, maybe not...
i want to be you
it's hard to spend a lifetime for myself
with the quakes and the storm
this“romance”is an error, and“surreal”
it's clear that i love your insensitiveness
like the hills and the sky
i would like to be merged into you
